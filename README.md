# Stash MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a concise set of tools to query and analyze an [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash) instance with composable, high‑precision filters, optimized caching for faster queries, automated intelligence for performer/scene analysis, and personalized recommendations based on usage and preferences.

### Advanced Filters for `get_all_performers`

This tool now supports advanced filtering by multiple physical and demographic criteria:

#### Basic Filters
- `favorites_only: bool = True` - Limit to favorite performers
- `country: str` - Filter by country
- `ethnicity: str` - Filter by ethnicity
- `eye_color: str` - Filter by eye color
- `hair_color: str` - Filter by hair color
- `measurements: str` - Filter by body measurements
- `piercings: str` - Filter by piercings
- `tattoos: str` - Filter by tattoos

#### Numeric Filters with Modifiers
- `height_cm: int` - Filter by height in centimeters
- `weight: int` - Filter by weight

#### Filter Modifiers
Each filter supports modifiers for different comparison types:
- `EQUALS` (default) - Exact match
- `NOT_EQUALS` - Not equal
- `GREATER_THAN` - Greater than (numeric only)
- `LESS_THAN` - Less than (numeric only)
- `BETWEEN` - Between two values (numeric only, requires `_value2`)
- `NOT_BETWEEN` - Not between two values (numeric only, requires `_value2`)

#### Range Parameters
For `BETWEEN` and `NOT_BETWEEN` filters:
- `height_cm_value2: int` - Second value for height range
- `weight_value2: int` - Second value for weight range

## Configuration

The server supports flexible configuration through environment variables:

### Configuration example for Claude Desktop/Cursor/VSCode
Add this configuration to your application's settings (mcp.json):

#### Using uv (recommended)
```json
"stash mcp server": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--directory",
      "/path/to/stash_mcp_server",
      "stash_mcp_server"
    ],
    "env": {
        "STASH_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:9999",
        "STASH_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    }
}
```

#### Using pip installation
```json
"stash mcp server": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "python3",
    "args": [
        "-m",
        "stash_mcp_server"
    ],
    "env": {
        "STASH_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:9999",
        "STASH_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    }
}
```

#### Using Docker
```json
"stash mcp server": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--env-file",
        "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
        "ghcr.io/donlothario/stash_mcp_server"
    ]
}
```

## Technical Notes
- Connection to Stash is performed with configurable retries.
- If the API key is missing, the server generates an error and does not start.
- GraphQL fragments used by queries are centralized in the code (`FRAGMENTS`).
- **Improved cache architecture**: Cache functions are separated from MCP decorators to avoid conflicts with Pydantic schema generation.
- **Advanced filtering**: Robust filter system with modifiers and range handling for complex queries.
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed information about active filters and query results for better debugging.
